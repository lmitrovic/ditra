Ditra is a project that supports all CRUD operations, as well as column filtering and sorting. When a table in a tree is selected, it is displayed on the right, and below it are all the tables that are related to it. It is possible to filter data by relations and for the selected row from the main table only relevant data from linked tables are displayed. Some of the other functionalities are searching the table by given parameters and generating reports using COUNT and AVG.
